# Man From Tennessee
Written by John R. Reeder and Chuck Sylvester, circa 1982
Written for guitar, I believe in the key of E or Am

Verse 1:  
I'm really not much of a man, you see  
It's been the women and the dogs and the kids and me  
My momma and my daddy didn't have much time for me  

Verse 2:  
I was born in South Tennessee  
My soul was rock but my heart was free  
I searched for truth but only drifted out to sea  

Chorus:  
Could you find the time to help a man from Tennessee  

Verse 3:  
I learned my songs with a couple of friends  
They were true to me until the very end  
Sometimes we lost our way, but we could always see  

Chorus:  
Could you find some time to help a man from Tennessee  

Bridge:  
My music taught me how to stand  
My friends helped me understand  
How to laugh out in the pouring rain   
How to smile right through the endless pain  

Chorus:  
Would you really want to help a man from Tennessee
